# Recursion

Ruby recursion projects as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion).

## Assignment 1 : The Fibonacci Sequence

Created two methods:
- Iteration (#fibs)
- Recursion (#fibs_rec)

both take a number and return an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. 

## Assignment 2 : Merge Sort

Created a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array.
